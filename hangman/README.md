## Hangman

A game of Hangman made with Python. The program asks the user to make a guess using a letter. Afterwards, the program checks to see if the guess is a valid input.
If the guess is in the secret answer, it will replace the dashes that conceal the answer until the answer is revealed. If the user guesses incorrectly, a body part will be added to the post for
each wrong answer. Once the user has made 7 wrong attempts, the game will end when the stick figure body is completed.
